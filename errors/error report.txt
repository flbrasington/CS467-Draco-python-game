  Image is attached.  I started at the point marked by the circle.
  With the changes to eliminate the Spider-Man crawling, I can now Superman jump tall builings in a single bound.
  I am not using the double jump feature (f key).  It seems to come from jumping (continuing to hold down z) and
  shooting the rope (continuing to hold down x) creating a floating effect.

  General observation:  When the up key is released, the player slides down to the end of the outstretched rope.
  I do not remember this being the case yesterday.

	Image is in folder.	 It appears that the player is in room t3_4 and that the exit room is t4_1.

	Image is in folder.  The room the player is in seems to be t3_7 but I am not sure which one is the room
	above it which is blocking the path.  It might be t3_5 but I don't think it is.  Maybe some way to print
  the room templates that are chosen should	be implemented to help debug these situations in the future.
