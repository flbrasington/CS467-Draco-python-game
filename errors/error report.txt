  Image is attached.  I started at the point marked by the circle.
  With the changes to eliminate the Spider-Man crawling, I can now Superman jump tall builings in a single bound.
  I am not using the double jump feature (f key).  It seems to come from jumping (continuing to hold down z) and
  shooting the rope (continuing to hold down x) creating a floating effect.

  General observation:  When the up key is released, the player slides down to the end of the outstretched rope.
  I do not remember this being the case yesterday.

	Image is in folder.	 It appears that the player is in room t3_4 and that the exit room is t4_1.

	Image is in folder.  The room the player is in seems to be t3_7 but I am not sure which one is the room
	above it which is blocking the path.  Maybe some way to print the room templates that are chosen should
	be implemented to help debug these situations in the future.
