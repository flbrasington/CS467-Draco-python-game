  Image is attached.  I started at the point marked by the circle.
  With the changes to eliminate the Spider-Man crawling, I can now Superman jump tall builings in a single bound.
  I am not using the double jump feature (f key).  It seems to come from jumping (continuing to hold down z) and
  shooting the rope (continuing to hold down x) creating a floating effect.

  General observation:  When the up key is released, the player slides down to the end of the outstretched rope.
  I do not remember this being the case yesterday.

	Once in the second level, the rope attaches to empty cells and travels through filled ones.  The image from
	15:27 shows the rope attaching to an empty area right above the player at the start of the level.  The image
	from 15:28 shows that the rope has some pixels below the platform instead of to the platform.  The image from
	15:29 shows the rope passing through a solid wall.
