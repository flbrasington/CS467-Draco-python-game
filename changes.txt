Changes made since last push to repo:

Organized the files so that all graphics, music, error reports and room templates are in their own directory.
All of the classes are in the "home" directory and the program is running on Main.py.  I also made it so that there is
an entry and exit point in each level.  This involved creating a new category of room templates where 7 is the entry/exit
point for the player.  The exit does not work yet.  I also fixed a weird bug that was making the rope start at a weird
point in the level.

-player.py & rope.py
Added in timer function. Now the player has to wait 1 sec (rope.py self.cool_down_time & check_cool_down())
This was added to avoid the player spamming the rope and jump button to 'fly' thru the levels
