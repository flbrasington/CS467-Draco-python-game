Changes made since last push to repo:

Organized the files so that all graphics, music, error reports and room templates are in their own directory.
All of the classes are in the "home" directory and the program is running on Main.py.  I also made it so that there is
an entry and exit point in each level.  This involved creating a new category of room templates where 7 is the entry/exit
point for the player.  The exit does not work yet.  I also fixed a weird bug that was making the rope start at a weird
point in the level.

-player.py & rope.py
Added in timer function. Now the player has to wait 1 sec (rope.py self.cool_down_time & check_cool_down())
This was added to avoid the player spamming the rope and jump button to 'fly' thru the levels

2/3/2017
-level.py
added a sprite group (not sure if a group is necessary since it is just one block) for the exit door to the room along
with all the necessary world shifting to make it stay in the right place

-player.py
added a collide check to see if the player is touching the exit sprite, if they are and the player presses up with
advance to the next level or exit the game if it is the last level.  Also added a variable that checks if 'up' was
pressed to exit the level so that the Main.py can check to see if that was requested and either move to the next level
or exit the game

-Main.py
added a check to see if the player was trying to move onto the next level based on the 'exit_level' variable added to
player.py.  Levels must be pre-loaded and added to the level_list like it was done on line 91-92.  This can be changed
to a for loop later depending on how many levels we want to do

2/7/17
-level.py
constructor for level and platform now take a level number and assign blocks and background based on level 1 or 2

-main.py
an initial level is now generated at the start of main.  all other levels will be constructed in the while not done loop
this will allow a single change to the new maxLevels variable to generate any number of levels.  Currently the setup will
only assign background and block images to levels 1 and 2 but a higher number can be generated with solid colors.
